## Open Source License

Dual licensing under both MIT and Apache-2.0 is the currently accepted standard by the Rust language
community and has been used for both the compiler and many public libraries since (see
[Why dual MIT/ASL2license?](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.6.0/complement-project-faq.html#why-dual-mitasl2-license)).
In order to match the community standards, o7 is using the dual MIT+Apache-2.0 license.
